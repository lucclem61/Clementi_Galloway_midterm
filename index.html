<hr>
    <p>European football is one of the oldest sports in the world dating back to the 15th 
    century, a good 300 years before American football. European football has the 
    biggest fan base of any other sport, let alone American football. Many people argue 
    over which sport should get the title of "football". Is can be a heated debate especially 
    since Europeans have had to hear their beloved game being referred to as "soccer." However, 
    European football deserves it's well earned nickname, "the beautiful game."

    <p>European football has a rich history and tradition that goes back over hundreds of years. 
    The oldest clubs in Europe have built a culture around the sport that has encapsulated 
    the fans. This rich heritage makes the wins and losses feel personal for supporters, creating 
    an emotional bond with their teams. The team rivalries in Europe are notorious for being colourful 
    and passionate, adding another exciting aspect to the entertainment. </p>

    <h2>American Football, The Real Superior Sport</h2>

        <p>American Football is the superior Sport for many reasons. In fact, so many I will choose 
        just a few to talk about. The first reason it is the better sport is due to its intensity. 
        It's 60 minutes of guys trying to take each other's heads off (figuratively) and win the game for their team. 
        Football players will leave blood on the field and be happy about it while soccer players will pretend like they 
        tore their acl after the wind picks up. Football players will take hard hits all game and walk away like it's nothing. 
        The games are just more action packed than soccer games.</p>

        <p>The next thing that makes it better is the exciting high scores. 
        You can spend 90 minutes watching guys run up and down a field and the game ends 1-0 or even 0-0. 
        Meanwhile you could spend 60 minutes watching an action packed, high flying, exhilarating sport that has games 
        end with scores in the 20s-40s range. It's an awesome feeling seeing your offense dominate and drop 30+ points on a team.
        Granted European Football can have some edxciting finishes to games but it is nothing like seeing the quaterback throw a 
        50 yard hail mary when the team is down 7 with 30 seconds left. It gets your adrenaline pumping and your blood rushing 
        seeing such high scoring action packed games.</p>

        <p>The last thing I will talk about is how tactical football actually is. 
        Football Players on both sides of the ball need to remember hundreds of different plays. 
        They spend hours every day learning the playbook in the offseason. 
        They also have to continue studying it during the season as coaches are constantly changing their plays. 
        Not to mention remembering how fakes and trick plays work the average NFL player needs to have a great memory and a fast memory. 
        They need to remember how these plays are designed when they are said by the coach during the game. 
        Not to mention the split second decisions a player has to make during the play. 
        Where the man your guarding is gonna go, where the qb is throwing too, which receiver the qb should throw too, and so many many more. 
        The thought process and planning at every position from head coach to kicker is concise and seriously thought out. 
        This is these guys careers and their passion and they are dead serious about being the best they can.</p>
